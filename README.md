### *Game Conceptual*

The Lottery contract operates in four distinct stages:

1. ***Stage 1: Entering the Lottery Pool:*** (`T1` seconds)

    This stage allows participants to join the lottery pool by submitting their chosen numbers and paying the required entry fee `0.001 Ether`.

2. ***Stage 2: Revealing Choices:*** (`T2` seconds)

    This stage ensures transparency by allowing participants to reveal the numbers they committed to during Stage 1.

1. ***Stage 3: Determining Winners and Transfer Reward:*** (`T3` seconds)
  
    <!-- The contract owner determines the winner based on the XOR value of valid choices. -->
   * If valid choices exist, the winner receives 98% of the reward, while the contract owner receives 2%. The contract owner determines the winner based on the XOR value of valid choices.
        ```
            winner = (player[0].choice âŠ• player[1].choice  âŠ• ... âŠ• player[num_participant-1].choice ) % num_participant
        ```
   * If no valid choices exist, the contract owner receives the entire reward.
   * This stage ensures fairness in selecting the winner and distributing the reward.

2. ***Stage 4: Withdrawal:*** (After Stage 3)
    
    This stage allows participants to reclaim their entry fee in the event that contract owner fails to determine a winner within a specified time.
